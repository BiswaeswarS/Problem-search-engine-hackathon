given a directed acyclic graph with n vertices numbered from to n and an array edges where edges i fromi toi represents a directed edge from node fromi to node toi find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable it s guaranteed that a unique solution exists notice that you can return the vertices in any order
given an array of strings words without duplicates return all the concatenated words in the given list of words a concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words not necesssarily distinct in the given array
given four integers length width height and mass representing the dimensions and mass of a box respectively return a string representing the category of the box the box is bulky if any of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to or the volume of the box is greater or equal to if the mass of the box is greater or equal to it is heavy if the box is both bulky and heavy then its category is both if the box is neither bulky nor heavy then its category is neither if the box is bulky but not heavy then its category is bulky if the box is heavy but not bulky then its category is heavy note that the volume of the box is the product of its length width and height
given an integer array nums a reducer function fn and an initial value init return a reduced array a reduced array is created by applying the following operation val fn init nums val fn val nums val fn val nums until every element in the array has been processed the final value of val is returned if the length of the array is it should return init please solve it without using the built in array reduce method
alice and bob are traveling to rome for separate business meetings you are given strings arrivealice leavealice arrivebob and leavebob alice will be in the city from the dates arrivealice to leavealice inclusive while bob will be in the city from the dates arrivebob to leavebob inclusive each will be a character string in the format mm dd corresponding to the month and day of the date return the total number of days that alice and bob are in rome together you can assume that all dates occur in the same calendar year which is not a leap year note that the number of days per month can be represented as
given an integer array nums return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence
you are given a m x n matrix grid initially you are located at the top left corner and in each step you can only move right or down in the matrix among all possible paths starting from the top left corner and ending in the bottom right corner m n find the path with the maximum non negative product the product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path return the maximum non negative product modulo if the maximum product is negative return notice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product
you are given an integer array nums of length n assume arrk to be an array obtained by rotating nums by k positions clock wise we define the rotation function f on nums as follow f k arrk arrk n arrk n return the maximum value of f f f n the test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a bit integer
an integer n is strictly palindromic if for every base b between and n inclusive the string representation of the integer n in base b is palindromic given an integer n return true if n is strictly palindromic and false otherwise a string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward
design your implementation of the circular double ended queue deque implement the mycirculardeque class mycirculardeque int k initializes the deque with a maximum size of k boolean insertfront adds an item at the front of deque returns true if the operation is successful or false otherwise boolean insertlast adds an item at the rear of deque returns true if the operation is successful or false otherwise boolean deletefront deletes an item from the front of deque returns true if the operation is successful or false otherwise boolean deletelast deletes an item from the rear of deque returns true if the operation is successful or false otherwise int getfront returns the front item from the deque returns if the deque is empty int getrear returns the last item from deque returns if the deque is empty boolean isempty returns true if the deque is empty or false otherwise boolean isfull returns true if the deque is full or false otherwise
the set n contains a total of n unique permutations by listing and labeling all of the permutations in order we get the following sequence for n given n and k return the kth permutation sequence
